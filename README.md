## Objective
To identify which unremodeled house in the dataset has the highest potential for value increase if remodeled before being sold.

## Overview
This project uses various machine learning models to predict the potential increase in house value after remodeling. The models used include:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- XGBoost

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on house features and sale prices, including:
- Overall quality (`OverallQual`)
- Living area (`GrLivArea`)
- Garage area (`GarageArea`)
- Basement area (`TotalBsmtSF`)
- First floor area (`1stFlrSF`)
- Bathrooms (`FullBath`)
- Total rooms (`TotRmsAbvGrd`)
- Year built (`YearBuilt`)
- Year remodeled (`YearRemodAdd`)

## Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and create a remodeling indicator (`IsRemod`).
2. **Feature Selection**: Select features based on domain knowledge and model importance.
3. **Model Training**: Train and tune models using `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.
4. **Simulation**: Simulate remodeling by adjusting `OverallQual` and `YearRemodAdd`.
5. **Prediction**: Predict sale prices post-remodeling and identify houses with the highest value increase.

## Results
### Model Performance
- **Linear Regression**:
  - House ID: 1298
  - Predicted Increase: $600,283.76
- **Random Forest**:
  - House ID: 1298
  - Predicted Increase: $173,944.32
- **GBM**:
  - House ID: 632
  - Predicted Increase: $158,673.30
- **XGBoost**:
  - House ID: 632
  - Predicted Increase: $166,723.89

## Conclusion
- Linear Regression and Random Forest models identified House ID 1298, while GBM and XGBoost identified House ID 632.
- The models show significant differences in predicted increases, highlighting the need for multiple models for robust analysis.
